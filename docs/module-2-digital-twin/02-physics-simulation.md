### Physics Simulation

Physics simulation is a critical aspect of robotics that allows developers to test and validate robot behavior in a virtual environment before deploying it in the real world. In this module, students use Gazebo, a powerful simulation platform, to model the physical interactions of humanoid robots, including gravity, collisions, friction, and dynamics.

By accurately simulating physics, students can predict how a robot will respond to different forces and environmental conditions. For example, a humanoid robot walking across uneven terrain or interacting with objects can be tested in a controlled virtual environment. This reduces the risk of damaging hardware during experimentation and allows for rapid iteration of algorithms.

Gazebo provides tools to define the mass, shape, and joint constraints of each robot component, ensuring realistic motion. Students learn to simulate sensors such as cameras and LIDAR, and observe how sensor data interacts with the robot’s control system. They also practice creating virtual environments with obstacles, ramps, and interactive elements to test navigation, balance, and manipulation tasks.

Through hands-on exercises, learners gain a deep understanding of how physics affects robotic performance. By mastering physics simulation in Gazebo, students can develop robust, safe, and efficient robots ready for real-world applications while minimizing trial-and-error on physical hardware.
