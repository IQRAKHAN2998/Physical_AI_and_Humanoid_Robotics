### Unity Interaction

Unity is a versatile platform for creating high-fidelity 3D simulations, enabling realistic visualization and interactive experiences for humanoid robots. In this module, students learn to integrate their digital twin models into Unity, bringing virtual environments to life with detailed rendering, lighting, textures, and physics interactions.

By using Unity, learners can simulate complex human-robot interactions, such as a humanoid robot navigating around people, responding to gestures, or manipulating objects in a cluttered environment. This helps students understand how AI algorithms perform in scenarios that closely mimic real-world conditions, bridging the gap between simulation and reality.

Students explore Unity’s features for scripting behaviors, controlling animations, and linking sensor data from Gazebo or ROS 2. For example, a humanoid robot’s arm movements can be animated in Unity while simultaneously receiving real-time control commands from a Python node via ROS 2. This integration allows learners to test robot responses in dynamic, interactive environments safely and efficiently.

By the end of this module, students will have hands-on experience in creating immersive simulations, enhancing robot perception and interaction skills. Mastering Unity interaction equips learners to design intelligent, visually rich, and responsive robots ready for deployment in both research and real-world applications.
