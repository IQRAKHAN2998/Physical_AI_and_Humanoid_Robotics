### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.

In this module, students explore the concept of a Digital Twin, which is a virtual representation of a physical robot and its environment. By creating a digital replica, developers can simulate real-world interactions, test algorithms, and predict system behavior without risking physical hardware. The module emphasizes physics simulation, environment modeling, and interactive design using tools such as Gazebo and Unity.

Gazebo provides a robust physics engine that enables accurate modeling of forces, collisions, and dynamics. Students learn to create virtual worlds, add obstacles, and simulate robot sensors and actuators within these environments. Unity complements this by offering advanced visualization and interactive capabilities, making it possible to design intuitive simulations and user interfaces. Through hands-on exercises, learners integrate their humanoid robot models into these simulations, observing how control algorithms affect motion, balance, and task execution.

By the end of this module, students understand how Digital Twins bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds, allowing safe, efficient, and repeatable testing of robotic systems. They gain practical experience in building environments, simulating realistic robot behavior, and preparing AI-driven robots for real-world deployment, forming a critical step toward mastering embodied intelligence in robotics.
