### Nav2

Nav2, or Navigation 2, is a ROS 2-based framework for autonomous path planning and navigation, particularly suitable for bipedal humanoid robots. This module introduces students to the core principles of motion planning, obstacle avoidance, and goal-oriented navigation using Nav2, enabling robots to move efficiently and safely in dynamic environments.

Students learn how Nav2 integrates sensor data from LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs to generate accurate maps and plan collision-free paths. The framework supports adaptive navigation algorithms that account for the unique constraints of bipedal robots, such as balance, step size, and joint limits. Through practical exercises, learners configure Nav2 parameters to allow humanoid robots to navigate complex terrains, avoid obstacles, and reach target locations autonomously.

Integration with ROS 2 topics and services ensures that the navigation stack communicates effectively with AI perception nodes, including Isaac ROS for localization and VSLAM. For example, a humanoid robot can dynamically adjust its walking trajectory based on real-time sensor feedback, ensuring stability while following a planned path.

By the end of this module, students gain hands-on experience in implementing autonomous navigation for humanoid robots, understanding how path planning, perception, and control work together. Mastery of Nav2 prepares learners to build intelligent, reliable, and agile humanoid robots capable of performing complex tasks in realistic environments.
