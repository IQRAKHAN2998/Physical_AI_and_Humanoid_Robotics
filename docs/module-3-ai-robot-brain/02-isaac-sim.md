### NVIDIA Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a powerful simulation platform designed for creating photorealistic virtual environments for humanoid robots. It allows students to test AI algorithms, perception systems, and robot behaviors in highly realistic scenarios, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment.

In this module, learners explore how Isaac Sim can generate synthetic data for training AI models. By simulating sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs in diverse environments, students can create large datasets without the limitations of physical hardware. Photorealistic rendering ensures that AI perception models trained in simulation transfer effectively to real-world conditions, reducing the sim-to-real gap.

Students also practice integrating their humanoid robot models into Isaac Sim, observing interactions with objects, navigating complex terrains, and performing manipulation tasks. By linking the simulation with ROS 2 using Isaac ROS, Python nodes can control robot movements, process sensor data, and test navigation or planning algorithms in real time.

Through hands-on exercises, learners gain experience in designing robust AI systems, generating synthetic training data, and validating perception and control pipelines. Mastering Isaac Sim equips students to develop advanced humanoid robots capable of intelligent, autonomous behavior in both virtual and physical environments.
