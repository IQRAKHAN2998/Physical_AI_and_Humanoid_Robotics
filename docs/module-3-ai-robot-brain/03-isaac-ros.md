### Isaac ROS

Isaac ROS is NVIDIA’s ROS 2 integration framework, providing hardware-accelerated algorithms for robotics applications, including Visual SLAM (VSLAM), perception, and navigation. This module teaches students how to leverage Isaac ROS to enable humanoid robots to perceive, map, and navigate complex environments efficiently.

Visual SLAM combines camera input with inertial sensors to build real-time maps of the environment while tracking the robot’s position. Using Isaac ROS, these computations are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs, allowing for high-performance perception even in computationally intensive scenarios. Students learn how to configure Isaac ROS nodes to subscribe to sensor topics, process visual and depth data, and provide pose and map information for navigation.

The module also covers integration with ROS 2 navigation stacks, enabling robots to plan paths, avoid obstacles, and reach goals autonomously. Practical exercises include configuring a humanoid robot to explore unknown environments, dynamically update maps, and execute navigation tasks with sensor feedback. By using Isaac ROS, students gain experience with GPU-accelerated algorithms that enhance the speed and reliability of AI-driven robot operations.

By the end of this module, learners will understand how hardware-accelerated perception and navigation pipelines function, allowing humanoid robots to operate intelligently and autonomously in dynamic and realistic environments.
