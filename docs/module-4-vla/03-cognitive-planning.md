### Cognitive Planning

Cognitive Planning focuses on translating high-level human instructions into actionable sequences for humanoid robots. By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, students learn to interpret natural language commands, such as "Clean the room," and convert them into a structured series of ROS 2 actions that the robot can execute autonomously.

This module teaches the principles of task decomposition, where complex instructions are broken down into smaller, manageable steps. For example, the command "Clean the room" can be decomposed into locating objects, identifying trash, picking up items, and placing them in designated locations. Students learn to map each step to corresponding ROS 2 nodes and services, integrating perception, navigation, and manipulation modules.

Practical exercises involve combining LLM reasoning with sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs. Learners implement pipelines where the robot perceives its environment, plans a sequence of actions, and executes them safely and efficiently. Error handling and adaptability are also emphasized, allowing the robot to adjust its plan based on real-time feedback.

By the end of this module, students will understand how AI can enable robots to reason, plan, and act based on natural language input. Mastery of cognitive planning equips learners to build intelligent humanoid robots capable of completing complex tasks in dynamic real-world scenarios.
