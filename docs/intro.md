# Create a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, we want you to write a textbook to teach a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (The course details are documented below).

## Excel in the Hackathon and Launch Your Journey as an AI Startup Founder

We’ve recently launched Panaversity (panaversity.org), an initiative focused on teaching cutting-edge AI courses. Alongside this, we’re working on publishing our first book, which you can explore at ai-native.panaversity.org. Our next milestone is to build a portal where authors can create AI-native technical textbooks, and readers can easily access and learn from them using AI Agents. We also plan to publish O/A Level, Science, Engineering, and Medical AI-native books to support students and professionals across disciplines. If you perform well in this hackathon, you may be invited for an interview to join the Panaversity core team and potentially step into the role of a startup founder within this growing ecosystem. You will get a chance to work with Panaversity founders Zia, Rehan, Junaid, and Wania and become the very best. You may also get a chance to teach at Panaversity, PIAIC, and GIAIC.
