### Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.  
Goal: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

### Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and deploying humanoid robots that can perform complex tasks while interacting naturally with humans. By integrating AI algorithms with physical robotics, learners understand how embodied intelligence allows robots to sense their surroundings, make decisions, and execute actions efficiently.
